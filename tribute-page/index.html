      <li><span class="date">1944-45</span>: Spends a short stint in the Navy before entering university.</li>
      <li><span class="date">1947</span>: Starzl's mother, Anna, dies of breast cancer. Her respect for the doctors that treated her during her terminal illness would inspire Starzl, who originally wanted to be a priest, to study medicine.</li>
      <li><span class="date">1947</span>: Graduates with a B.A. in Biology from Westminster College in Missouri.</li>
      <li><span class="date">1952</span>: Starzl completes his medical school training, having obtained a M.S. in Anatomy (1950), a Ph.D. in Neurophysiology, and an M.D. with distinction from Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, IL. It was during this time that he wrote a highly-cited paper which describes a novel technique to record the brain's response to sensory stimuli.</li>
      <li><span class="date">1952-59</span>: Trains as a surgeon at Johns Hopkins, the University of Miami, and Northwestern University.</li>
      <li><span class="date">1959-61</span>: Serves on the surgical faculty of Northwestern University, supported in his first five years by a prestigious fellowship for promising young doctors, the Markle Scholarship.</li>
      <li><span class="date">1962</span>: Begins his 18-year tenure at the University of Colorado, during which time he would serve as the Director of Surgery at the Denver VA hospital and Chairman of the University Surgery Department.</li>
      <li><span class="date">1967</span>: After laying the theoretical foundation for organ transplantation during his post-doctoral studies, Starzl performs the first successful liver transplant on a 19-month-old girl suffering from liver cancer.</li>
      <li><span class="date">1981</span>: Moves from the University of Colorado to the University of Pittsburgh, freeing him from administrative responsibility and leaving him to develop a multiple organ transplantation program.</li>
      <li><span class="date">1983</span>: Establishes the clinical utility of cyclosporine, the first FDA-approved immunosuppressant for use in organ transplants. The drug prevents organ rejection by limiting the immune system of the host, and continues to be widely used.</li>
      <li><span class="date">1984</span>: Performs the first simultaneous heart and liver transplant on Stormie Jones, a six-year-old whose story made her a media sensation.</li>

      <li><span class="date">1999</span>: The Institute for Scientific Information documents Starzl as the most cited researcher in the world.</li> 
      <li><span class="date">4 March 2017</span>: Dies peacefully in his home in Pittsburgh, with his wife of 36 years, Joy, and his family.</li>
