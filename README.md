# FreeCodeCamp projects

This repository contains all of the projects I've completed for the [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) platform. Right now, I'm only working through the front-end development modules, so the directories in this repo simply contain the contents of those projects. In the future, I'll organize the different courses into subfolders.

## Codepen links

Per the requirements of FCC's curriculum, I developed and completed all of these projects on the [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io) platform. I really like Codepen for quick prototyping, but it's a bit too ephemeral and non-libre for my tastes, hence this Github backup of all of my work. You can, if you wish, view the live versions (with Codepen unit tests, which I've edited out for this backup) using the links below.
